                <em>Too Many Daves</em> takes its name from the
                eponymous poem by Theodor Geisel
                aka Dr. Seuss:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote text-right">
                "Did I ever tell you that Mrs. McCave<br>
                Had twenty-three sons and she named them all Dave?<br>
                Well she did.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that wasn't a smart thing to do."

                The poem is itself about names, and naming things.
                Its playfulness, a signpost for the spirit of this endeavor.
                At the same time, it's a powerful cautionary tale;
                the moral of which reflects precisely the focus, and seriousness, of the mission at hand.
