                The poem is itself about names, and naming things.
                Its playfulness sets the tenor for the spirit of the entire network.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet even more so, it's a cautionary tale;
                its powerful moral of not wasting opportunites
                defining the focus, and seriousness, of the mission at hand.
            </p>
