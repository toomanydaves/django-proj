                        Open source is a transformative way of working together.
                        It's about collaboration and sharing,
                        where the obstacles to doing so have been so thoroughly diminished
                        they might as well be nonexistent,
                        and the benefits made so unmistakeably apparent,
                        it's impossible not to feel inspired.
