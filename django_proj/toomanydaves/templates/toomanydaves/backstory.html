                        What was just a construct, a vision in my mind,

                    <p> So we'll have to see where it goes from here, but

                        Even though it's still very much my baby,
                        <em class="brand">Too Many Daves</em>
                        was always meant to exist apart from me,
                        with room to accomodate anyone who wants to stand
                        for self-expression, creativity, tolerance and wonder.

                    <p>
                        So thanks very much for hearing me out!
