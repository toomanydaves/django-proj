            Did I ever tell you that Mrs. McCave<br>
            Had twenty-three sons and she named them all Dave?<br>
            Well she did.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that wasn't a smart thing to do<a

            <b>Thankfully</b>
            life presents us with immeasurable opportunities to exercise our creativity.<br>
            Sadly though as was the case in the naming of the Daves,
            if we don't act, they simply pass us by.
