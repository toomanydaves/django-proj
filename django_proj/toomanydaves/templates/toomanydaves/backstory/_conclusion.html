                <h3>Mo' Projects, Mo' Lives's Works</h3>
                <p>
                    So I wanted to present them together, to keep them together,
                    to be able to move them forward, and more easily keep an eye on them.
                    But then I thought, why just present my own projects when there are so many other
                    inspiring works to include.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many already having changed the world.
                    So first, I created a portfolio
                    with space to collect other noteable works that similarly reflect
                    the spirit of <small class="text-uppercase">Too Many Daves!</small>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of these are done in collaboration.
                    Most just known to <small class="text-uppercase">Too Many Daves!</small> as
                    worthy of admiration.
                    All in various stages of realization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All, I'd submit, worthy of your attention.
                </p>

                        He's talking about writing software, but it could just as easily
                        be applied to being active creatively and sharing work in general.

                    In addition to a portfolio of projects,

                    is intended to be a network and forum,
                    <a href="/portfolio/toomanydaves"> a project itself</a>,
                    devoted to creativity.
                    In this respect, it is still in its infancy;
                    in fact it's literally just crossed that
                    most crucial threshold of existence

                    or as the case may be, the World Wide Web.
                    I can't predict where it will go from here, but
                    hey, it has you reading about it, and really, how exciting!

                    Even though it's still very much my baby,
                    <small class="text-uppercase">Too Many Daves</small>
                    was always meant to exist apart from me,
                    with room to accomodate anyone who wants to stand with me
                    for self-expression, creativity, tolerance and wonder.

                        <em>Jacke</em> (YA`kuh) is the German word for jacket,
                        and my last name since I got married.
                        I used to be Weiner
                        <span class=&quot;long-dash-before&quot;>
                        a name I always had a hard time appreciating.</span>
                        Luckily there are others in my family 
                        capable of not taking themselves so seriously.
                        Like my step-mother, whose maiden name is Imoe Godfrey.
                        She married my dad and, no kidding,
                        willingly, in fact happily, became Imoe Weiner.
