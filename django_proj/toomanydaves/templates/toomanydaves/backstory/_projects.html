                        I was already living in Europe
                        when I set myself to the task of learning to code in earnest.
                        I wanted to focus on writing educational software.

                        The birth of my two sons
                        has taught me a lot about the person I want to be
                        and what I want to accomplish.
                        As my thoughts have turned more existential,
                        I've turned my development skills to
                        an app to help me, and whoever else,
                        set and reach personal goals.

                        When I was in Austin,
                        and previously and afterwards in New York,
                        as well as a teacher, I'd been a student myself.
                        <span class="long-dash-after">I learned how to draft,
                        weld, solder glass and work with wood</span>
                        I began making things in earnest.

                        In the intervening years,
                        I've met many fellow artists, makers and designers
                        working in a variety of contexts.

                            and these like-minded folks
                        </span>
                        a platform where works of art can be curated

                        the artists, designers and makers,

                <h3>1 life's (ongoing) work</h3>
                <p>
                    These endeavors represent who I am, have been,
                    and a big part of what I would like to accomplish with my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'd been working on them individually, but wanting a way of keeping track of them.
                    Giving them a context, being able to present them together.
                    So I set out to build an online portfolio, and it was in dealing with them collectively
                    when I realized the thread running through them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A thread that reflects certain values that have been instilled in me
                    and informs what I want to accomplish.
                    A desire to empower, support and inspire myself and others.
                    In short, <span class="text-uppercase">Too Many Daves</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And since I'd already been walking around with it tattoo'd on my arm for ten years,
                    the online portfolio now had a name.
