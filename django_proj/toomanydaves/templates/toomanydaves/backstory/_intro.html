                    has its origins</span>
                    twenty years ago and nearly half a world away at Habibi's Hutch,
                    <a
                        href="http://www.habibishutch.com/"
                        target="_blank"
                    >a wonderful preschool in Austin, TX</a>,
                    where I had the good fortune to first encounter
                    <a href="/poem">the little-known poem</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It took a couple times reading it aloud
                    <span class="long-dash-before long-dash-after">
                        and the immediate sound of little ones' laughter
                    </span>
                    until I started to appreciate
                    what was so special in its text.
                    As I've followed along my path,
                    its message has stayed with me,
                    providing real inspiration along the way.

                <p>
                    That way, which began teaching children,
                    eventually lead out of the classroom
                    and to the following projects:
