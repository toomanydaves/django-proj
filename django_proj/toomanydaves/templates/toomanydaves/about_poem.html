                    with a playfulness that defines

                        Did I ever tell you that Mrs. McCave<br>
                        Had twenty-three sons and she named them all Dave?<br>
                        Well, she did.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that wasn't a smart thing to do.<br>
                        You see, when she wants one and calls out, "Yoo-Hoo!<br>
                        Come into the house, Dave!" she doesn't get one.<br>
                        All twenty-three Daves of hers come on the run!<br>
                        This makes things quite difficult at the McCaves'<br>
                        As you can imagine, with so many Daves.<br>
                        And often she wishes that, when they were born,<br>
                        She had named one of them Bodkin Van Horn<br>
                        And one of them Hoos-Foos.&nbsp;&nbsp;And one of them Snimm.<br>
                        And one of them Hot-Shot.&nbsp;&nbsp;And one Sunny Jim.<br>
                        And one of them Shadrack.&nbsp;&nbsp;And one of them Blinkey.<br>
                        And one of them Stuffy.&nbsp;&nbsp;And one of them Stinkey.<br>
                        Another one Putt-Putt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another one Moon Face.<br>
                        Another one Marvin O'Gravel Balloon Face.<br>
                        And one of them Ziggy.&nbsp;&nbsp;And one Soggy Muff.<br>
                        One Buffalo Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;And one Biffalo Buff.<br>
                        And one of them Sneepy.&nbsp;&nbsp;And one Weepy Weed.<br>
                        And one Paris Garters.&nbsp;&nbsp;And one Harris Tweed.<br>
                        And one of them Sir Michael Carmichael Zutt<br>
                        And one of them Oliver Boliver Butt<br>
                        And one of them Zanzibar Buck-Buck McFate ...<br>
                        But she didn't do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;And now it's too late.
